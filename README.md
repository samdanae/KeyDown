# KeyDown

Generate Markdown (and beyond) simply by defining your content in plain objects. 

Output is based on the natural structure of the state data itself, so that means there is no markup needed, nothing to learn - not even markdown.

## Overview

[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is great. It lets anyone express entire articles and documents in an easy to handle, readable syntax.

KeyDown is another spin on marking up content, but without any syntax. Its purpose is to represent objects using their naturally nested structure. 

KeyDown organises content into headings of varying levels based on how the object graph is nested.
